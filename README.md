# Rubix-Cube-Solver
This project takes input via java utility Scanner and outputs the moveset required to solve the Rubix cube in constant time!  
Current model has been developed in vanilla Java.  
  
Looking ahead, for future implementation, I would like to change the input taking mechanism and the GUI.  
+ Implement an image processing library which maximises the accuracy of colour and contour detection.  
+ Implement an animator which can render a cube with the piece coordinates and also animate the moves the user needs to make.    
+ Upload this to a web stack.  
+ As part of another project, Build a mechanical arduino machine which can scan the colours and render the moves after the scanning process.
